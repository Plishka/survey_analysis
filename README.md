9. What percentage of respondents program in Python in each age category?
10. Which industries are the most prevalent among respondents (who work remotely) in the 75th percentile for average compensation?

## **Steps and Code**

### **1. Number of Respondents Completed the Survey**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

survey = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/plish/Desktop/Python_HW/Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023/survey_results_public.csv')
schema = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/plish/Desktop/Python_HW/Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023/schema.csv')

# Number of respondents completed the survey
Q1 = survey['ResponseId'].nunique()
print(f'{Q1} respondents took part in the survey')
# 89,184 respondents took part in the survey

### **2. Number of Respondents Who Answered All Mandatory Questions**
```python
# Number of respondents who answered all the mandatory questions
questions = set(schema.qname.unique()) & set(survey.columns)  # Connecting survey with survey schema to get all mandatory questions
Q2 = survey.dropna(subset=questions).shape[0]
print(f'{Q2} respondents have answered all the questions in the survey')
# 2,032 respondents have answered all the questions in the survey
